            <p> My name is Jose Arteaga, I am a student at UCLA's Extension software development bootcamp. As a software engineer my goal is to

                software development was to find a stable career in an increasingly growing industry. Take a look at my portfolio which includes 
                some of the projects thatI've worked on, and for any questions questions or conerns feel free to contact me through my contact
